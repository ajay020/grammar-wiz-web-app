# Sentence Fragments 🧩

Unraveling the mystery of sentence fragments — those incomplete puzzle pieces that yearn to be whole. Understanding and avoiding sentence fragments is key to constructing clear and cohesive writing. 📚🚧

## What is a Sentence Fragment?

A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence that lacks a main clause or fails to express a complete thought. It often feels like something is missing, leaving readers puzzled. 🧩❓

### Examples of Sentence Fragments:

1. _In the garden._ (Fragment: What happened in the garden?)
2. _Eager to start her journey._ (Fragment: Who was eager? What did she do?)

## How to Identify Fragments:

1. **No Main Clause:**

   - Check for a subject and a verb that form a complete thought.
     - _Fragment:_ _Across the field, a spectacular sunset._

2. **Dependent Clause Alone:**

   - Ensure that dependent clauses are properly attached to independent clauses.
     - _Fragment:_ _Although she worked hard. She didn't win._

3. **Incomplete Thoughts:**
   - Confirm that the sentence conveys a clear idea.
     - _Fragment:_ _Asking many questions during the lecture._

## Fixing Sentence Fragments:

1. **Combine with Independent Clause:**

   - _Fragment:_ _Eager to start her journey._  
     _Fixed:_ _Eager to start her journey, she packed her bags._

2. **Add Missing Elements:**

   - _Fragment:_ _In the garden._  
     _Fixed:_ _In the garden, flowers bloomed._

3. **Make Independent Clauses:**
   - _Fragment:_ _Running through the park._  
     _Fixed:_ _She enjoyed running through the park._

Understanding and correcting sentence fragments contribute to clearer and more effective writing. So, piece together those fragments to create sentences that captivate and convey complete thoughts. 🧩📝
