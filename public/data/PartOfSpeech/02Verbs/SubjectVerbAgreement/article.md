# Subject-Verb Agreement 🤝📜

Let's unravel the art of subject-verb agreement—a harmonious dance between the doer of the action and the action itself. Get ready for language synchronization! 🕺🗣️

## What is Subject-Verb Agreement?

In every sentence, the subject (who or what the sentence is about) and the verb (the action or state of being) must agree in number. This means that a singular subject pairs with a singular verb, and a plural subject pairs with a plural verb. It's all about maintaining linguistic balance! ⚖️🎯

## Singular Subjects and Verbs 🙋‍♂️➡️🙋‍♂️

When your subject is singular, your verb should be too. They're like language soulmates, always in sync.

- _Example:_ The cat _is_ sleeping on the windowsill.
- _Example:_ She _runs_ five miles every morning.

## Plural Subjects and Verbs 🙋‍♀️➡️🙋‍♀️

When your subject is plural, your verb should join the party and become plural too. It's a team effort!

- _Example:_ The dogs _are_ barking loudly.
- _Example:_ They _play_ instruments in the band.

## Tricky Situations 🤔🔄

### Compound Subjects 🌐

When subjects are joined by "and," they usually require a plural verb.

- _Example:_ Peanut butter and jelly _are_ my favorite sandwich fillings.

### Indefinite Pronouns 🤷‍♂️

Some indefinite pronouns are always singular, some are always plural, and a few can be both based on context.

- _Example:_ Everyone _has_ a role to play.
- _Example:_ Both of the teams _are_ strong.

### Collective Nouns 🤝

Collective nouns can be singular or plural based on whether the group is acting as one unit or as individuals.

- _Example:_ The team _is_ winning the game. (acting as one unit)
- _Example:_ The team _are_ preparing for their matches. (acting as individuals)

## Tips for Success 🌟💡

1. **Identify the True Subject:**

   - Look beyond words that come between the subject and verb.

2. **Watch Out for Indefinite Pronouns:**

   - Words like "everyone" or "nobody" are singular.

3. **Consider Collective Nouns Carefully:**
   - Think about whether the group is acting together or as individuals.

Subject-verb agreement is the choreography that keeps our sentences in perfect rhythm. So, let your subjects and verbs waltz through language with grace and unity! 💃🕺🗣️
