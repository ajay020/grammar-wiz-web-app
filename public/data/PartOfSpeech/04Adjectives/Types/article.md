# Types of Adjectives 🌈📚

Adjectives, like a versatile paint palette, come in various hues, each serving a distinct purpose in enriching our language. Let's explore the different types of adjectives and understand how they contribute to the colorful tapestry of our expressions. 🎨📝

## 1. Descriptive Adjectives 🌟

Descriptive adjectives add vivid details to a noun, painting a clear picture in the reader's mind. They answer questions about the color, size, shape, or other qualities of the noun.

### Example:

- The **sparkling** stars illuminated the night sky.
- She wore a dress with **striking** patterns.

## 2. Limiting Adjectives 🎯

Limiting adjectives narrow down the scope of a noun, specifying which one or how many. They provide essential information to avoid ambiguity.

### Example:

- I'll take **this** book, not that one.
- There are **five** apples on the table.

## 3. Demonstrative Adjectives 👉

Demonstrative adjectives point to specific nouns, indicating whether they are near or far in space or time.

### Example:

- I prefer **those** shoes over these.
- **This** movie is my favorite.

## 4. Interrogative Adjectives ❓

Interrogative adjectives are used to ask questions about a noun. They usually introduce a question and seek more information.

### Example:

- **Which** book did you borrow?
- **Whose** idea was it?

## 5. Possessive Adjectives 🤲

Possessive adjectives indicate ownership or possession. They tell us to whom or to what something belongs.

### Example:

- This is **my** house.
- **Their** opinions differ.

## 6. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives 📊

Comparative adjectives are used to compare two nouns, while superlative adjectives compare three or more. They express degrees of qualities.
